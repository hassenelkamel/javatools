Description: Little general purpose Java utilities. These tools are exported to the MPI homepage at 
   http://mpii.de/yago-naga/javatools
Therefore, this project should only contain independent general purpose utilities that are of more interest than one project.

The modification policy is as follows:
If it's bug fixes or additional methods, then please feel free to update the code in the repository. 
With other things (major changes, added functionality to existing methods, new classes etc) keep them 
in private folders until sure that it's a stable and general-purpose class. You can use the package javatools.test
for such private classes.
